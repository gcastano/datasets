It is the longest-running series of Big Brother in the franchise worldwide currently on air. Based on the Original Dutch Version created by Endemol, the show sees a number of different Housemates, divided by gender, social backgrounds and geographical locations locked up together in a House, where the viewing Public can watch them twenty-four hours a day, and vote them out of the House as they choose to. The housemates live in isolation from the outside world in a house custom built with everyday objects, like fridges and a garden. The house also includes cameras and microphones in most of the rooms to record all of the activity in the house. The only place where Housemates can be away from the other contestants is in the Diary Room, where they can confess their true feelings. The winner is the last contestant remaining in the house, and receives a large cash prize. Housemates are evicted weekly throughout the show by the viewing public. The show's name comes from George Orwell's 1948 novel 1984, a dystopia in which Big Brother is the all-seeing, omnipotent leader of Oceania.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Megan Mullally and Cheryl Hines come to ABC in the new comedy In the Motherhood, which takes a look at the importance of family and friends while trying to juggle motherhood, work and love lives in an overly complicated modern world. The story focuses on Rosemary, Jane and Emily, who represent mothers we all know. Rosemary is a free-wheeling mom who plays it fast and loose when it comes to parenting her teenaged son, Syd. Married numerous times, but currently single, Rosemary lives by her own rules. Much to the amazement of the other moms, her nontraditional parenting style has yielded a son much more responsible than she. Rosemary's best friend, Jane, is a recently divorced working mother of a pre-teen, Annie, and a baby girl, Sophie, who is just trying to keep her career and home afloat. Having just returned to work after giving birth eight months ago, Jane struggles to find a happy balance – lucky for her she has her ""manny"", Horatio, to help out. Jane's younger sister, Emily, sees herself as the model stay-at-home-super-mom for her two young children, Esther and Bill. Emily's home is a work of art, and her kids are polite and sweet—everything has its place in her world. Married to Jason, Emily takes parenting as seriously as any mother could.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

The special broadcasts from New York City's Times Square, and prominently features coverage of its annual ball drop event, along with live and pre-recorded musical performances by popular musicians from Times Square and Hollywood, respectively. Its creator and namesake was the entertainer Dick Clark, who conceived <i>New Year's Rockin' Eve</i> as a younger-skewing competitor to Guy Lombardo's popular and long-running New Year's Eve big band broadcasts on CBS. The first two editions, which were hosted by Three Dog Night and George Carlin, respectively, and featured Dick Clark assuming the role of Times Square reporter, were broadcast by NBC for 1973 and 1974, respectively. In 1974-75, the program moved to its current home of ABC, and Clark assumed the role of host.</p><p>Following the death of Guy Lombardo and the decline of the Royal Canadians' special, <i>New Year's Rockin' Eve</i> grew in popularity, and became ingrained in pop culture—even prompting Clark himself to make appearances on other programs in parody of his role. To this day, <i>New Year's Rockin' Eve</i> has remained the highest-rated New Year's Eve special broadcast by the United States' major television networks; its 2012 edition peaked at 22.6 million home viewers—not including viewers watching from public locations which are not measured by Nielsen.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From hockey pucks and hand saws to drill bits and frozen french fries, 'How It's Made' offers viewers a first-hand look at how these deceptively simple objects are constructed. Thousands of humdrum items are put to good use on a daily basis, but it's easy to overlook how things like aluminum ladders, firefighter helmets, matches and engine blocks are constructed. <b>How It's Made: Dream Cars</b> visits dozens of assembly lines where raw materials become finished products right before the viewers' eyes. In each episode of the series, viewers will be amazed to see how many common items are manufactured in high-tech factories around the world.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
